## Who we are
Omni Ops was officially founded in 2023 after a long discussion over the power of OpenAI's ChatGPT and what this means for the future. The founders, Kevin Schrock and Keenan Fraylick, both saw the potential in enhancing people's workflow using AI. After this discussion, Kevin and Keenan decided to found a company dedicated to developing and testing potential products that use AI.

### Kevin Schrock

In all of these roles, Kevin noticed a common goal: automation. Every team had multiple goals, all pointing towards automating redundant tasks.

-   Open Source - All of our projects will be open source. We believe in full transparency of our applications and welcome community contributors to improve what we build.
