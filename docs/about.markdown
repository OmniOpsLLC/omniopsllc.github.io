## Our Ethos
### "We build practical open-source applications that help you with every day life" 

## Our Story
Omni Ops started after a conversation between two friends over the power of technology, and how it can change lives with simple builds. 
Our goal as an organization is to find small issues effecting us every day and create free, open source solutions to these issues. Our focus is to develop quick monthly builds of products and beta test our solutions live with our audience. 

## Our Values
### Practical Solutions
We focus on developing practical solutions that will solve simple problems you face everyday.
### Fast Development 
We focus on quick monthly builds to quickly build and test solutions.  
### Free and Open
Our solutions will always be open-source and the code available for free to individuals.
### Education
We document and post the creation process of our products so you can learn and grow with us.
