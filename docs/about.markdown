## About Us
### "We build practical open-source applications that help you with every day life" 

## Our Story
Omni Ops started after a conversation between two friends over the power of technology, and how it can change lives with simple builds. 
Our goal as an organization is to find small issues effecting us every day and create free, open source solutions to these issues. Our focus is to develop quick monthly builds of products and beta test our solutions live with our audience. 

## Our Values
### Practical Solutions
We focus on developing practical solutions to every day problems so you the user can focus on whats really important. 
### Fast Development 
We develop and push out builds quickly to test their funcitonality and determine if their is a viable use or not. 
### Free and Open
Our solutions are always open-source and available for free in some capacity. Life changing products should not be limited to those with disposable income.
